# 1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
total = 0
# for x in numbers:
#     total += x
# print(total)
# 2. Write a Python program to multiplies all the items in a list.
total = 1
# for x in numbers:
#     total *= x
# print
#3. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list
# print(max(numbers))
#4. Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list.
# print(min(numbers))
# 5. Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
# sample = ['abc','xyz','aba','1221']
# count = 0
# for index in sample:
#     if len(index) >= 2:
#         temp = list(index)
#         if temp[0] == temp[-1]:
#             count += 1
#
# print("count: " + str(count))
#7. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list
# sample = [1,2,4,1,2,4,5,3,5,6,2]
# print(set(sample))
# 8. Write a Python program to check a list is empty or not
# a = []
# if not a:
#     if not a:
#         print("list is empty")
# else:
#     print("list is not empty")
# 9. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list
# sample = [1,2,4,5]
# # copy = sample.copy()
# # print(copy)
